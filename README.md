# React Video Player

### The project

In this project I implement a video player with ability to add videos. The videos can be chosen from the playlist and are played continuously.

### Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
